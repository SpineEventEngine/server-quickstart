 *
 * As long as module dependencies are periodically updated, the version-update
 * commits often pollute the VCS log for `build.gradle` file. Often, such commits interfere
 * with the important changes to the build procedure.
 *
 * Having a distinct configuration file like this one allows to trace dependency version changes
 * and other configuration updates separately.
